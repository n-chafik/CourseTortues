Predict the exact position of  tortoises in different types of races
we extract data from the server http://tortues.ecoquery.os.univ-lyon1.fr ( accessible only from univ1 network), we have 4 types  of races, each on has different number of tortoises,
then we predict the type of a tortoise by its behaviour, ( the sppeds it runs with during different tops, a top means 3s, in every top every tortoise make a mouvement in a speed we 
should know )

After prediciting the type of tortoise, we try to predict it's position in a given Future TOP.
